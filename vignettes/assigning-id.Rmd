This is a vignette to help you become familiar with using `assign_id()`. 
Check out https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/mrgda/reference/assign_id.html
for additional documentation and examples.

`assign_id()` helps you assign a unique numeric identifier to each
subject in your data set. Its purpose is to ensure the same numeric
identifier is assigned to each subject across multiple data sets. 

Below, we will go through the two main use cases of `assign_id()`:
- first ID assignment
- assigning ID according to an existing file

# Load packages

```{r setup}
library(mrgda)
```

# Setup



```{r}
data <- readr::read_csv(system.file("derived/pk.csv", package = "mrgda"))
```
